# Reports Section Improvements & Fixes

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the Reports section to address user feedback about data presentation and accuracy issues.

## ✅ **Issues Fixed**

### 1. **Raffles by Category Display** 
**Problem**: Raffles by category were displayed as large cards taking up too much space and not providing detailed information.

**Solution**: 
- **Converted to professional table format** with sortable data
- **Added detailed columns**: Category, Total Raffles, Percentage, Visual Distribution
- **Enhanced visual elements**: 
  - Color-coded indicators
  - Progress bars for visual distribution
  - Percentage badges
  - Sorted by count (descending)
- **Better data presentation**: More compact and informative layout

### 2. **Payment Method Trend Accuracy**
**Problem**: Payment method performance data was incomplete and inaccurate, showing only basic count and revenue.

**Solution**: 
- **Enhanced Backend Data Structure**: Updated `getPaymentMethodBreakdown()` in `AdminAnalyticsService.php`
- **Added comprehensive metrics**:
  - Total transactions
  - Successful transactions
  - Failed transactions
  - Success rate (%)
